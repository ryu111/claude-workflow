# Ralph Loop 使用場景

## Philosophy

Ralph embodies several key principles:

### 1. Iteration > Perfection
Don't aim for perfect on first try. Let the loop refine the work.

### 2. Failures Are Data
"Deterministically bad" means failures are predictable and informative. Use them to tune prompts.

### 3. Operator Skill Matters
Success depends on writing good prompts, not just having a good model.

### 4. Persistence Wins
Keep trying until success. The loop handles retry logic automatically.

## When to Use Ralph

**Good for:**
- Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria
- Tasks requiring iteration and refinement (e.g., getting tests to pass)
- Greenfield projects where you can walk away
- Tasks with automatic verification (tests, linters)

**Not good for:**
- Tasks requiring human judgment or design decisions
- One-shot operations
- Tasks with unclear success criteria
- Production debugging (use targeted debugging instead)

## Real-World Results

- Successfully generated 6 repositories overnight in Y Combinator hackathon testing
- One $50k contract completed for $297 in API costs
- Created entire programming language ("cursed") over 3 months using this approach
